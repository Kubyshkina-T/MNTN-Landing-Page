Landing Page

This project is a responsive landing page created for learning purposes and front-end skill development.

The design is based on a Figma template and was used as a visual reference for building the layout and structure. During development, alternative fonts were selected in compliance with licensing requirements and suitable for web use, while preserving the overall visual style.

The main focus of this project was practical work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as building an adaptive interface for different screen sizes.

🔧 Key features:

Semantic HTML structure

Responsive layout (mobile, tablet, desktop)

Parallax effect implemented in the hero section

CSS animations and modern layout techniques

JavaScript for interactive and visual effects

Typography adapted with respect to licensing requirements

🎯 Purpose:

This project was created as a hands-on exercise to improve front-end development skills, attention to layout details, and understanding of responsive design. Implementing the parallax effect and adapting the interface across devices provided valuable practical experience.
